        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">The Game of Life</a>, an interesting example of a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton">cellular automaton</a> created by British mathematician John Conway.
            The Game of Life is played on a grid where each cell is said to be either alive or dead. On each iteration of the game every
            cell is updated according to its current state, the state of its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal), and a
            simple set of rules about how many living neighbors each cell has. The rules are as follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>A living cell with less than two living neighbors dies.</li>
            <li>A living cell with two or three living neighbors lives on.</li>
            <li>A living cell with more than three living neighbors dies.</li>
            <li>A dead cell with exactly three living neighbors becomes a living cell.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Click on the cells above to color them in and then press play to see how they evolve, or press one of
            the preset buttons above to see some examples of patterns that others have discoverd. If you
            would like to see other examples of known patterns check out this Game of Life <a href="https://conwaylife.appspot.com/library/">pattern library</a>.
        </p> 
        <p class="disclaimer">
            <em>Note:   </em>The Game of Life takes place on an infinite grid. Due to the bounded nature of the grid above, this implementation wraps the edges of the
            grid on itself. For smaller patterns this will make no difference, but a pattern that grows to overflow the grid may intersect with itself in a way that
            would not happen on an infinite grid.
